# SNAKEBYTES
I liked snakes since I was a child but nothing had me prepared to what was going to happen one day. I was probably around 8 years old when I went to a Zoo Safari with my family, we saw every kind of animals just being free *(this was in Belgium or France)* and when it was time for us to lunch we made our way to the restaurant and at the entrance there was this huge vivarium and I immediatly sat down on the ground to look at the snakes, to my surprise, no... to everybody's surpise every single snake came out of their little holes and started crawling towards the glass. I was very happy and felt like the God of snakes, and since that day I believe that I have a genuine connection with snakes.

After one month attending Lambda School, I decided to dive into a personal project; **my love for Snakes**.

I decided to make this project to test my skills, to start from scratch and utlize what I know and the idea is to keep upgrading this and eventually make it my portfolio. 

Snakebytes is an unfinished project with a lot room for improvment, eventually the website will be hosted on Netifly.
